## Common Patterns & Techniques
1. Local Optimization
   - Making best choice at each step
   - Looking for local patterns

2. Interval Scheduling
   - Meeting room allocation
   - Activity selection

3. Optimization Problems
   - Maximum/minimum value
   - Optimal arrangement

4. Two-Pass Solutions
   - Forward and backward passes
   - Multiple perspectives

## My suggestions for Greedy Problems
- Prove greedy choice property
- Consider counter-examples
- Think about why local optimal leads to global optimal
- Look for sorting opportunities
- Consider multiple passes over the data
