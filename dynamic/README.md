## Common Patterns & Techniques
1. Tabulation (Bottom-Up)
   - Iterative approach
   - Uses tables to store results

2. Memoization (Top-Down)
   - Recursive approach
   - Caches intermediate results

3. State Transitions
   - Define clear recurrence relations
   - Identify optimal substructure

4. Space Optimization
   - Rolling array techniques
   - State compression

## My suggestions for Dynamic Programming Problems
- Start with the recursive solution
- Draw out the state transition diagram
- Look for overlapping subproblems
- Consider space optimization after solving
- Handle base cases carefully
