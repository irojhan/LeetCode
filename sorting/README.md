## Common Patterns & Techniques
1. Custom Sorting
   - Comparator functions
   - Special sorting rules

2. Multi-pass Algorithms
   - Dutch national flag
   - Bucket sort

3. Sorted Array Operations
   - Two pointer technique
   - Merge operations

4. Linked List Sorting
   - Merge sort
   - Insertion sort

## My suggestions for Sorting Problems
- Consider time/space complexity requirements
- Look for opportunities to sort in-place
- Think about stability requirements
- Handle duplicate elements properly
- Consider custom comparison logic
