## Common Patterns & Techniques
1. String Manipulation
   - Substring operations
   - Character counting
   - String building

2. Pattern Matching
   - Regular expressions
   - KMP algorithm
   - Rabin-Karp

3. Window Sliding
   - Substring problems
   - Character frequency

4. Dynamic Programming
   - Palindrome problems
   - Pattern matching

## My suggestions for String Problems
- Consider string immutability
- Watch for string concatenation efficiency
- Handle special characters and spaces
- Think about case sensitivity
- Consider using string builder when appropriate
