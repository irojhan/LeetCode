## Common Patterns & Techniques
1. Graph Traversal
   - DFS (Depth-First Search)
   - BFS (Breadth-First Search)

2. Topological Sort
   - Cycle detection
   - Dependency resolution

3. Union Find
   - Connected components
   - Cycle detection

4. Special Graph Problems
   - Bipartite graphs
   - Minimum spanning trees
   - Shortest paths

## My suggestions for Graph Problems
- Draw out the graph for visualization
- Consider both directed and undirected cases
- Watch for cycles in the graph
- Think about connectivity requirements
- Consider using adjacency lists vs matrices
